# Scripting examples
## Overview
TapisCLICICLE's can be scripted to automatically execute tasks for managing Tapis services.
You can do this using:

**Bash Script:** execute a collection of TapisCLICICLE commands from one file

**Jupyter Notebook/Python:** By importing the TapisCLICICLE's constituent packages, most notably the tapisObjectWrappers (which governs the CLI interface with the Tapis API through the TACC Tapis python library, and adds additional function to streamline operations), you can also write python scripts to automate CLI functions.
